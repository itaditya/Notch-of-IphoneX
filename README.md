# Description
Test how your website will look if the Iphone X's notch comes to other apple products. 

# Is this of any use 

## TL;DR
Yes, it is !

## Long Version - 
You know how our beloved **Apple** likes to strip away functionalities (ahem! Headphone Jack, Fingerprint Scanner, USB ports ahem!) and justify that they did it to make room for other features. Well this year to remedy their idotic descisions, they have **added** (yeah you read it right, they have added something to that brick) a sexy gigantic notch to the top which puts every past design to shame. You can see how much people are loving it. That just shows that this trend is here to stay.

One more defining habit of Apple is to maintain harmony among all their products. So there is high probability that they will soon bring this cutting edge 22nd century's design statement to **Macs** and **Ipads**.

Well that's great news but it still does not justify the use case of this plugin. I hear you, I'm coming to my point, just hold your horses for a minute.

The thing with with us, the Web Developers is that we can never attain even a wee bit of inner peace in this world. 'Coz every time we think we're done their arrives one more device and more screen factor for which we have to redesign our whole website.
By adding that notch on that brick Apple has forced even introvertial developers to rant in their project's README.

If you're reading this and saying hey I'm a Web Designer too, beware your product manager would be coming to your cubicle any day to assign you a new task. Before he comes, add this extention in Chrome and start redesigning your website to work on the next gen Macs. You may even get a promotion someday. Huh! who am I kidding, we'll never get a promotion
